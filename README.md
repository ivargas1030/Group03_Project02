# Link Library

### *Sara Damyan, Bryan Jerger, Jason Miller, Iliana Vargas*

## Description
We built a website where a user can create a list of categories, then enter URL links under each category.  
The links for each category are rendered together and clickable to launch the stored link in a new tab. 
Or, if the user prefers to search Youtube by keyword, then they may also take that route.

## Technologies Used
1. Server: Node and Express
2. Backed by a MySQL database and Sequelize ORM
3. Deployed with Heroku
4. 3rd Party API: Youtube
5. CSS Styling: Bootstrap
6. Followed an MVC paradigm
7. HTML: Handlebars

## User Story
I need a place to *collect* and *organize* the various web links I use based on a topic type.
